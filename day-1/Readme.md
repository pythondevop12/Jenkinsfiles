What is Jenkins?

Jenkins Architecture

Groovy overview and syntax

Setup Jenkins locally

Setup Groovy Plugin

Hello World in Groovy inside Jenkins

📂 Practice:

Install Jenkins via Docker

Create your first freestyle project

Use Groovy Console inside Jenkins

✅ Day 2: Jenkins Pipelines 101
What is a Jenkins pipeline?

Declarative vs Scripted pipelines

Basic Declarative syntax

Using stages, steps, and agents

📂 Practice:

Write a simple 3-stage declarative pipeline

Add echo, sh, and checkout scm steps

✅ Day 3: Groovy Scripting Essentials
Variables, data types, lists, maps

Conditionals (if, switch)

Loops (for, each, while)

Functions in Groovy

📂 Practice:

Write Groovy scripts to manipulate strings, lists, and maps

Use Groovy console in Jenkins to run test scripts

✅ Day 4: Scripted Pipelines with Groovy
Groovy-based Scripted Pipelines

node, stage, steps

Using loops and conditionals in pipelines

Nested stages and dynamic pipeline generation

📂 Practice:

Create a scripted pipeline with parallel stages

Add logic to retry a failed step

✅ Day 5: Parameters, Environment & Tools
Input parameters in pipelines

Environment variables and credentials

tools block and custom tool installation

Use of params, env, and withCredentials

📂 Practice:

Write a pipeline that accepts user input

Access Git credentials securely in the pipeline

✅ Day 6: Jenkins Shared Libraries
What are Shared Libraries?

Structure: vars/, src/, resources/

Create reusable functions and pipeline templates

Versioned libraries from Git

📂 Practice:

Create and use a shared library for common pipeline steps

Call custom Groovy functions from vars/hello.groovy

✅ Day 7: Real-World CI/CD Project
Building and testing a Java/Maven or Python project

Integrating with GitHub

Post-build actions (email, archive artifacts, Slack)

Writing a complete pipeline with build → test → deploy

📂 Practice:

Clone a sample project

Write a complete CI/CD pipeline using scripted or declarative syntax

Trigger via webhooks or poll SCM
